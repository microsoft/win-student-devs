# Day 10: Create application shortcuts

![Placeholder Banner Only. Replace when final assets ready.](_media/day-01.png)

Welcome to day 10 of the [30 Days of PWA](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/30Days-blog) series! Today's blog post will walk you through how to make it easy for your users to jump immediately to common task pages within your app using Shortcuts.

## WHAT WE'LL COVER TODAY

| **What is a Shortcut?** | Provide users with quick access to key tasks |
| **Defining Shortcuts** | Add `shortcuts` to your Web App Manifest |
| |

<br/>You’re likely already familiar with the concept of shortcuts. If you’ve ever opened the context menu on an app icon, you’ve seen something like this:

![The Twitter PWA context menu in Windows 11, providing quick access to posting a new tweet, direct messages, and more.](_media/day-10-01.png)

Here you can see the Twitter PWA providing quick access to compose a new Tweet, search, and access both mentions and direct messages. But how did they do that? It’s actually a pretty straightforward process in the Web App Manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "My App",
  "shortcuts": [ /* One or more ShortcutItem objects */ ]
}
```

The `shortcuts` member allows you to define an array of shortcut items. Each shortcut item is an object:

```json
{
  "name": "Today's agenda",
  "url": "/today",
  "description": "List of events planned for today"
}
```

This is a simple example that defines the `name` of the shortcut (the visible text), where it should navigate the PWA too (`url`), and some descriptive text that may be provided to assistive technologies by the host operating system. You can also define a `short_name` if you really need it.

To customize things a bit more, you also have the option of defining a set of `icons` for each shortcut item:

```json
{
  "name": "Today's agenda",
  "url": "/today",
  "description": "List of events planned for today",
  "icons": [ /* One or more ImageResource objects */ ]
}
```

Defining these is exactly the same as defining an app icon using the `icons` member, which we covered on [Day X](#).

## Putting it all together

As a real-world example, here’s how I’ve implemented shortcuts on my own site:

```json
{
  /* other stuff */
  "shortcuts": [
    {
      "name": "Notebook",
      "url": "/notebook/",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/i/icons/notebook.svg",
          "type": "image/svg+xml",
          "purpose": "any monochrome"
        },
        {
          "src": "/i/icons/notebook.png",
          "type": "image/png",
          "sizes": "120x120",
          "purpose": "any monochrome"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Speaking",
      "url": "/speaking-engagements/",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/i/icons/mic.svg",
          "type": "image/svg+xml",
          "purpose": "any monochrome"
        },
        {
          "src": "/i/icons/mic.png",
          "type": "image/png",
          "sizes": "120x120",
          "purpose": "any monochrome"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Publications",
      "url": "/publications/",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/i/icons/books.svg",
          "type": "image/svg+xml",
          "purpose": "any monochrome"
        },
        {
          "src": "/i/icons/books.png",
          "type": "image/png",
          "sizes": "120x120",
          "purpose": "any monochrome"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Interviews",
      "url": "/interviews/",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/i/icons/chat.svg",
          "type": "image/svg+xml",
          "purpose": "any monochrome"
        },
        {
          "src": "/i/icons/chat.png",
          "type": "image/png",
          "sizes": "120x120",
          "purpose": "any monochrome"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this code I’ve defined 4 shortcuts: "Notebook," "Speaking," "Publications," and "Interviews." As the `name` values are brief and straightforward, I didn’t add a `short_name` or `description` for any of them. Each has an associated `url` and I’ve defined two icon options for each: one is crisp, vector SVG and the other is a bitmap PNG. I’ve also let the host operating system know they are monochrome (via `purpose`) in case it wants to toggle the color to match its own light/dark theme.

## A few final notes

It’s worth noting that you should be selective about how many shortcuts you list for your app. Each operating system supports a different, but finite number of shortcut slots. If you include too many, they may not all be shown. For that reason, you should organize your shortcuts in order of priority, from most important to least important. Browsers are instructed to pay attention to this order and will drop shortcuts from the end of the list first, if it comes to that.

Also, since you have full control over the URL for shortcuts, you might consider adding a query parameter that enables you to track usage of the Shortcuts feature. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "Today's agenda",
  "url": "/today?utm_source=shortcut",
  "description": "List of events planned for today",
  "icons": [ /* One or more ImageResource objects */ ]
}

```

And that’s really it. Shortcuts is a relatively simple, but powerful tool when it comes to providing convenience for your users. You should definitely take advantage of it.
