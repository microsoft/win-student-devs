**Author: Beth Pan | [@beth_panx](https://twitter.com/beth_panx)**

Welcome to day 30 of the [30 Days of PWA](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/30Days-blog) series. You made it! Let's look back at our journey over the past month, review key concepts and learnings, and talk about next steps to continue your self-study.

## Recap & Resources

### Week 1: Core Concepts

![Visual guide to core concepts week.](./core-concepts/_media/week-1.png)

We started our 30-day journey by learning [what is a Progressive Web App (PWA)](./core-concepts/01.md). Following the introduction, we talked about [fundamental building blocks of a PWA](./core-concepts/02.md): HTTPS, service workers, and web app manifest. We took a deeper dive into each block to learn how to make a PWA [installable](./core-concepts/03.md), [reliable](./core-concepts/04.md), [work offline](./core-concepts/05.md), and [capable](./core-concepts/06.md). Finally, we summarized this week's learning by [taking an existing application and iteratively enhancing it for Progressive Web App functionality](./core-concepts/07.md).

### Week 2: Advanced Capabilities

![Visual guide to advanced capabilities week.](./advanced-capabilities/_media/week2-roadmap.png)

Week 2 of #30DaysOfPWA is all about new exciting capabilities available to modern Progressive Web Apps. Many advanced features and APIs have been brought to the web platform over the last couple of years as part of the "Project Fugu" effort, enabling a whole new class of applications to be built on top of the web. In this week, we learn about [PWA and Web Standards](./advanced-capabilities/01.md), [creating app shortcuts](./advanced-capabilities/02.md), [sharing content](./advanced-capabilities/03.md), [displaying content](./advanced-capabilities/04.md), [caching data](./advanced-capabilities/05.md), [background sync](./advanced-capabilities/06.md), and [notifications](./advanced-capabilities/07.md).

### Week 4: Platforms and Practices

![Visual guide to platforms and practices week.](./platforms-practices/_media/week4-roadmap.png)

To close the series of #30DaysOfPWA, we present you with best practices of building great Progressive Web Apps. We answer the following questions to help you make design, development, and distribution decisions for your PWAs: [What types of apps should be installable?](./platforms-practices/01.md) [How do you set an engagement strategy?](./platforms-practices/02.md) [How can you get maximum discoverability by distributing to app stores?](./platforms-practices/03.md) [Which caching strategy should you choose to have the best user experience while offline?](./platforms-practices/04.md) [Why use web components for PWA maintainability?](./platforms-practices/05.md) [What about authentication?](./platforms-practices/06.md) And finally, [what does it mean to have great UI/UX for your PWAs?](./platforms-practices/07.md)
