**Author: Beth Pan | [@beth_panx](https://twitter.com/beth_panx)**

Welcome to our new learning series focused on the fascinating world of Progressive Web Apps (PWA)!

![It's time to fall in love with PWA banner with author list.](_media/kickoff.jpg)

Starting February 14th, 2022, for 30 days, we will publish articles that aim to introduce developers to Progressive Web App. We will have content that covers 0-level to 200-level topics. Each post should take you 5-10 minutes to read and is followed by a sample snippet or exercise. You will need some basic web development knowledge to follow along. We hope that beginners will quickly pick up the content and that experts will also learn a few new things. 

## The Roadmap

The series of #30DaysOfPWA is structured into 4 top-level topics:
* `Core Concepts`: Learn the fundamental concepts and components of a PWA.
* `Advanced Capabilities`: Explore web capabilities APIs, status, and examples of use.
* `Developer Tools`: Learn about key authoring, debugging, auditing, testing and packaging tools for PWA.
* `Platforms & Practices`: Learn good practices and platform-specific support for PWA.
