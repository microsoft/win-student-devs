<h1 id="packaging-for-the-windows-store">Packaging for the Windows Store</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Great! You’ve just finished your web app and you are ready to send it off into the stores! Luckily for you, PWA Builder makes that as easy as pie. PWA Builder makes it possible to ship your app into multiple stores including the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. In this article we will focus on how to use our tools to package your PWA for the Microsoft Store, via the Partner Center. This is the last step, sharing your PWA with the world and now its time for all your hard work to pay off! Before we get started, here are some things you might want to have ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 512px by 512px icon (at least)
<ul>
<li>This will be used for your app icon</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Screenshots
<ul>
<li>For the Microsoft Store, you’re going to want laptop/tablet sized screenshots of your app to display in a carousel on your product description page. The exact pixel dimensions will be given to you in the Partner Center, where you will be publishing your app for the Microsoft Store (more on that later)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Short Description &amp; Long Description
<ul>
<li>The short description may be the same as what you have in your manifest while the long description is a more in-depth summary of what your app is and what it does</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A privacy policy if your app can access, collect, or transmit personal information (data that could be used to identify a person).</li>
<li>A personal Microsoft account (create one <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.7/signup.live.com">here</a> if needed)</li>
<li>$20 to pay for your Partner Center account.This covers the monitoring of your app and prevents spam apps from being submitted. (Google Play Store: $25, Apple App Store: $99)</li>
<li>The URL to your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above four items, you are ready to begin.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-packaging">Step 1: Packaging</h2>
<p>In order to package for the Windows store, you are going to want to navigate to <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.7/pwabuilder.com">pwabuilder.com</a> and enter the url to your web app on the home page.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/07_pwabuilder_home.png" alt="pwa builder home page" /><figcaption>pwa builder home page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After a few tests run to verify the quality of your PWA, you’ll receive a report card detailing what you do well and some areas for improvement.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/07_pwabuilder_rc.png" alt="pwa builder report card page" /><figcaption>pwa builder report card page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the bottom of this page, you can press “Next” and you will be at the publishing page of PWABuilder. You can press “Store Package” in the Windows section and you are greeted with a pop up to input a few options.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/07_pwabuilder_pub.png" alt="pwa builder publish page" /><figcaption>pwa builder publish page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In a new tab, you are going to want to head over to <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.7/partner.microsoft.com">Partner Center</a> and register your app.</p>
<p><strong>It is important that you register your app on Partner Center with the same name you listed in your manifest. When it comes time to upload your app bundles, it will check if the bundle matches the name of the registered app.</strong></p>
<p>Information on how to register your app can be found <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.7/blog.pwabuilder.com/docs/publish-a-new-app-to-the-microsoft-store">here</a> and information on <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.7/blog.pwabuilder.com/docs/finding-your-windows-publisher-info">where</a> to find the necessary Ids can be found here. Once you have inputted your publisher information, you can press generate and download your app bundles.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-partner-center">Step 2: Partner Center</h2>
<p>If you are inside of your app on Partner Center, you will see a button that says, “Start your submission”. After clicking on that you will see a list of options you will need to take care of before your submission is ready to be reviewed. Since you made sure to have everything on the checklist above, these sections should be a breeze.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/07_pc.png" alt="partner center submission page" /><figcaption>partner center submission page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After completing each task under each headers, your app is ready for review. These tasks will include setting up your product description page, getting your IARC rating, and uploading your app bundles that you got from PWA Builder. The review process takes about 24 hours and the feedback will either be precisely what was wrong with your submission so you can fix it or a congratulations message letting your know that your submission has been processed and your app will be in the store within the next two hours.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/07_store.png" alt="windows store webboard product description page" /><figcaption>windows store webboard product description page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>PWA Builder helps you to create store ready PWAs with robust descriptions pages: all while keeping the app submission process as simple as possible.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-microsoft-store">Why the Microsoft Store?</h2>
<p>The Microsoft store is an excellent place for your app to live. All of your in-app purchases (whether that be through Stripe or a custom payment system) go 100% to you. Microsoft will not take a cut. All of your analytics that you have running for your website will behave seemlessly. And most importantly, PWAs submitted through the Microsoft Store are TRUE PWAs; meaning they are not wrapped in a webview. There will be no “gotchas” or extra hoops to jump through in order for your app to feel native. It will just work. I promise I am not making this up, I submitted my very own app, “Sync’d - a Social Calendar App”, to the Microsoft Store in early February. I downloaded the app and it looked flawless, exactly like I expected. The cherry on top is that my app was reviewed, approved and in the Store in 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>PWABuilder makes packaging for the Microsoft Store easier than ever. For additional resources on how to package and much more, you can visit the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.7/blog.pwabuilder.com">PWABuilder Blog</a> page.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="test-automation">Test Automation</h2>
<p>Test Automation is the practice of <em>executing tests automatically</em> to validate software product functionality, then <em>using testing insights</em> to iteratively improve product quality. Test Automation is key to continuous delivery in modern DevOps culture: build-deploy pipelines keep software products in a continuous state of readiness for production release.</p>
<p>Why explore Test Automation for PWA? Two reasons: growing test complexity &amp; better tooling capability.</p>
<h4 id="testing-complexity">Testing Complexity</h4>
<p>Progressive Web Apps combine the reach of traditional web apps with the richer capability of platform-native apps. The first needs <em>cross-browser</em> testing to ensure usable experiences across all targeted browsers. The second needs <em>progressive enhancement</em> testing strategies to validate the enhanced experiences available to more capable devices.</p>
<p>Increased frequency of testing (e.g., on every feature commit or bug fix) coupled with many testing granularities (unit, integration, end-to-end) and configurations (browsers, device platforms) makes manual testing time-consuming and error-prone. This is where test automation excels, reducing time to detect issues, eliminating operator errors, and scaling effectively with cloud resources.</p>
<h4 id="tooling-capability">Tooling Capability</h4>
<p>Adopting automated testing strategies today is a no-brainer thanks to the rich ecosystem of tools and technologies available to web developers. Modern web automation software can execute user actions and other operations on a web browser without human intervention. Check out the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/test-and-automation/test-and-automation">Microsoft Edge docs</a> for more on relevant testing tools and technologies for web development, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webdriver-chromium/c-sharp">WebDriver</a></em> - a W3C standard wire protocol for out-of-process clients to remotely instruct browsers.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-protocol-chromium">DevTools Protocol</a></em> - directly inspect, debug, and profile, Chromium-based browsers like Edge.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a></em> - a Node.js <em>library</em> for browser automation using DevTools Protocol.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/playwright">Playwright</a></em> - <em>framework</em> for reliable end-to-end testing of modern web apps, across browsers.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/test-and-automation/webhint">webhint</a></em> - linter for accessibility, performance, security, PWA and cross-browser compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll focus on <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev"><em>Playwright</em></a> in this post - but do explore the other resources to learn how they fit into your testing toolkit.</p>
<h2 id="test-pyramid">Test Pyramid</h2>
<p>To craft an Agile testing strategy, it helps to use visual metaphors like this <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Cohn-Succeeding-with-Agile-Software-Development-Using-Scrum/PGM201415.html">practical test pyramid</a> that organizes our thinking around two guiding principles: (1) Write tests at various granularities, and (2) Write <em>fewer</em> tests as you go higher up the pyramid.</p>
<p>What does testing granularity mean? My version of the pyramid has unit testing at the base, with exploratory testing at the top. Test automation helps with the bottom four layers, while manual testing is key to uncovering “gaps” that automated testing might overlook at the top.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/6-test-pyramid.png" alt="Visualization of Practical test pyramid" /><figcaption>Visualization of Practical test pyramid</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In implementing the strategy, we want <em>many small, fast tests</em> at the base, and <em>fewer more coarse-grained tests</em> as we go higher. There are numerous unit testing libraries and tools that make the first objective achievable. But end-to-end test automation can be <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheImportanceOftestAutomation">“notoriously flaky”</a> given the many “browser quirks, timing issues, animations, and unexpected UI interactions” that we need to deal with.</p>
<p>This is where having a reliable testing framework like Playwright really helps. Its <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/api/class-suite#suite-tests">test hierarchies</a> make it easy to compose high-level <em>test suites</em> from low-level <em>test cases</em> - and use <em>test configurations</em> with multiple <em>test projects</em> to create maximum flexibility. The <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/intro">test runner</a> can focus on execution, running tests in parallel for efficiency, using multiple projects for cross-browser coverage, and capturing traces for post-execution analysis.</p>
<h2 id="testing-pwa">Testing PWA</h2>
<p>Next, let’s think about the <em>functional</em> specification of these tests - what kinds of features (unit testing) and interaction workflows (end-to-end testing) should we consider for Progressive Web Apps? Here’s one way to approach this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PWAs are web apps.</strong> Start with existing <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Testing_strategies">“strategies for carrying out testing”</a> for web apps, and identify the optimal testing configurations (target devices, browsers) for your intended audience.</li>
<li><strong>PWAs have additional <a href="../core-concepts/01.md">desirable characteristics</a></strong> to validate. We know from the <a href="05.md">previous post</a> that <em>auditing tools</em> are ideal here and can be integrated into a test automation workflow it they expose a programmable interface. Ex: <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/abhinaba-ghosh/playwright-lighthouse">playwright-lighthouse</a> makes it easy to run Lighthouse audits as part of your end-to-end testing workflow.</li>
<li><strong>PWAs may have functional testing requirements</strong> for core components, that are automation-friendly. Ex: we can <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-set-offline">emulate offline mode</a> to test service workers and caching strategies. Read this <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/medium.com/dev-channel/testing-service-workers-318d7b016b19">testing service workers</a> post for useful guidance.</li>
<li><strong>PWAs may use new or experimental <a href="../advanced-capabilities/01.md">web capabilities</a></strong> that are unevenly supported across browsers and devices. We can use <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection">feature detection</a> to test for their existence on target devices, and execute conditional test actions based on the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>But how can we put these specifications into implementation for reliable end-to-end testing? Let’s talk about Playwright!</p>
<h2 id="hello-playwright">Hello, Playwright!</h2>
<p><a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev">Playwright</a> is an open-source testing framework that enables reliable end-to-end testing and automation for modern web applications. It comes with a built-in <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/next/intro">Playwright Test Runner</a> for test automation, and a <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/next/library">Playwright Library</a> to simplify integration with third-party solutions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/6-hello-playwright.jpg" alt="A Visual Introduction to the Playwright Testing Framework" /><figcaption>A Visual Introduction to the Playwright Testing Framework</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Playwright has a number of benefits that differentiate it from other test automation frameworks. Scan the visual guide for more details on each: * It has a unified <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-playwright">API</a> for use across browsers and device platforms. * It enables mobile web testing with <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/emulation">native emulation</a> and rich <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bdfe92f8a7499644c431c5c05de17d71e6006084/packages/playwright-core/src/server/deviceDescriptorsSource.json">device profiles</a>. * It has multi-language support - including TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, Python and .NET. * No flaky testing - with <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/actionability">auto-waiting</a> and <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions">web-first assertions</a> eliminating messy timeouts. * No limits - aligns with modern web architectures, runs out-of-process, and supports multi-everything. * Powerful tools - for authoring, debugging, profiling, and reporting tests and execution. * Full isolation - with browser contexts ready in ms, fast execution and <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel">parallelization</a> options.</p>
<p>Want to get hands-on experience with the various capabilities? Check out the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/MarcusFelling/demo.playwright">demo.playwright</a> repository for code examples showcasing test scenarios for accessibility, android, authentication, performance (DevTools &amp; Lighthouse), and visual-comparison. Plus, learn how <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/ci">Continuous Integration</a> options like GitHub Actions work seamlessly with Playwright, right out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="using-playwright">Using Playwright</h2>
<p>Playwright currently has two options to kickstart your end-to-end testing journey: * Use the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/intro">Getting Started</a> guide to use Playwright from the command line. * Use the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/ms-playwright.playwright">Playwright Test for VSCode</a> extension (<em>in preview</em>) to use Playwright from the IDE.</p>
<p>For now, we’ll use the first option since the extension is still in preview and works only with the latest version of Playwright Test. In an earlier post, I <a href="../core-concepts/07.md">PWA-enabled an existing web app</a>. Today, I’ll revisit that project and instrument it for end-to-end testing with Playwright. Ready? Let’s go.</p>
<h3 id="install-playwright">1. Install Playwright</h3>
<p>Since I’m scaffolding Playwright tests for an <em>existing</em> project, I’ll use the command below. If you are <em>creating</em> a new project, just add the project name as the final argument.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">$ npm init playwright</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The output looks as shown (compressed for clarity). Note that you can choose to get a GitHub Actions workflow instrumented for you during setup. The scaffolding process may take a while the first time since it installs Playwright (Test runner and library) and all supported browsers (Chromium, Firefox and Webkit) by default.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1">Need to install the following packages<span class="op">:</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-16" title="16">✔ Success<span class="op">!</span> Created a Playwright Test project at <span class="op">&lt;</span>....<span class="op">&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The end result: three key files - a test <em>specification</em>, a test <em>configuration</em>, and a <em>GitHub Actions workflow</em> for continuous integration. We’ll review these later.</p>
<h3 id="run-playwright-test">2. Run Playwright test</h3>
<p>The process ends by suggesting we run <code>npx playwright test</code> so let’s do that. We see that the default test specification apparently defines <em>75</em> tests and uses <em>3 workers</em> (one for each browser project), completing the entire run in 35 seconds.</p>
<pre><code>$ npx playwright test
Running 75 tests using 3 workers
...
  75 passed (35s)

To open last HTML report run:
  npx playwright show-report</code></pre>
<h3 id="view-the-html-report">3. View the HTML Report</h3>
<p>Excellent! The default tests ran and passed! And hey - we have a report so let’s check that out!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1">$ npx playwright show<span class="op">-</span>report</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" title="3">  Serving HTML report at http<span class="op">:</span><span class="co">//127.0.0.1:9323. Press Ctrl+C to quit.</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The report looks something like this. Note how it provides execution time stats on a <em>per-test (case) + per-browser (project)</em> basis, and for the spec (test suite) as a whole.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/6-playwright-report.png" alt="Playwright HTML Report" /><figcaption>Playwright HTML Report</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The HTML reporting format allows you to drill down further into test steps, and break down the time taken for executing each test action. This is what the report looks like when you click on the first line item, and drill down into details. For instance, we can see the test step involved, along with the actual code that was executed from the script.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/6-playwright-report-detail.png" alt="Playwright HTML Report" /><figcaption>Playwright HTML Report</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="validate-github-actions-workflow">4. Validate GitHub Actions workflow</h3>
<p>Great! We validated the test script locally and checked that it ran against all browser targets <em>and</em> generated a report that we were able to view locally. The setup step also created a <code>playwright.yml</code> file with the GitHub actions workflows for running Playwright tests and uploading reporting artifacts for post-run analysis.</p>
<p>Let’s validate that this works by committing our code to GitHub to trigger the workflow. You can see the initial scaffolded code in my <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/fearlessly-dev/recipe-me/tree/add-playwright">add-playwright</a> branch with these key files: * <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/fearlessly-dev/recipe-me/blob/add-playwright/.github/workflows/playwright.yml">playwright.yml</a> = GitHub Actions workflow * <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/fearlessly-dev/recipe-me/blob/add-playwright/e2e-tests/example.spec.js">e2e-tests/example.spec.js</a> = Test specification * <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/fearlessly-dev/recipe-me/blob/add-playwright/playwright.config.js">playwright.config.js</a> = Test configuration</p>
<p>Merging that branch into main triggers <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/fearlessly-dev/recipe-me/actions/runs/1919689804">the GitHub action</a> as anticipated, leading to the entire suite of tests being run in the cloud. The test run took <code>5m 40s</code> with the bulk of the time (~4m) used for installing Playwright and browsers. We can also see the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/fearlessly-dev/recipe-me/suites/5498490318/artifacts/175855529">HTML Report Artifact</a> available for download and local viewing.</p>
<p>🎉 Time to celebrate! We have an <strong>end-to-end testing harness setup with continuous integration using GitHub Actions</strong> for our project. It’s time to start customizing the test script and configuration to be more aligned to your project needs. We don’t have time to dive into details, but let’s take a quick look at the two key files to know.</p>
<h3 id="inspect-the-configuration-file">5. Inspect the Configuration File</h3>
<p>The Playwright configuration file lets you specify <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions">test options</a> for running multiple test projects concurrently, and <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig">execution options</a> to control how those tests are executed by Playwright. The <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/fearlessly-dev/recipe-me/blob/add-playwright/playwright.config.js">playwright.config.js</a> file in the default setup looks something like this (cleaned up for clarity):</p>

<p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>projects</code> property defines target browsers to run the test against</li>
<li>The <code>workers</code> property decides the degree of parallelization of the runs</li>
<li>The <code>reporter</code> property selects the type of report (HTML) generated for the run</li>
<li>The <code>trace</code> property requests that traces be recorded only on first retry</li>
</ul>
<p>We can now customize this in many ways. Some options to try: * Set <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer#recording-a-trace">trace</a> to <code>on</code> to trigger recording, then view the data with Trace Viewer. <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/dev.to/azure/004-tool-talk-hello-trace-viewer-2a61">Read this post</a> for more details. * Add <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#emulation">emulator targets</a> to <code>projects</code> - validate responsiveness of app experiences. * Set <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#automatic-screenshots">screenshot</a> to <code>on</code> - make Playwright Test capture screenshots after every test for analysis. * Set <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#record-video">video</a> to <code>on</code> - make Playwright Test record videos after every test for analysis.</p>
<p>Note: Every such action has a related cost and complexity. It’s good to experiment with various configuration options in your local test environment - then use the reports to iterate for efficiency in time and resource usage.</p>
<h3 id="inspect-the-test-script">6. Inspect the Test Script</h3>
<p>Start by looking at the quickstart guide’s <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/next/intro#first-test">first test</a> script to understand key aspects of the test specification. Here is what that looks like:</p>

<p>Some observations: * <code>page</code> is the most common <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/api/class-fixtures#fixtures-page">fixture</a> used in tests, creating an isolated context for running that test. * <code>page.locator</code> creates a <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator">Locator</a>, a view into page based on an associated selector. * <code>expect(..).toHaveText(..)</code> is an example of a web-first <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions">Assertion</a> with convenience async matchers that enforce auto-waiting for reliable testing.</p>
<p>You can learn more about these and other core concepts like test hooks, browser contexts, and explore the Playwright API, by scanning the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/intro#installation">documentation</a>. Now, look at the scaffolded <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/github.com/fearlessly-dev/recipe-me/blob/add-playwright/e2e-tests/example.spec.js">e2e-tests/example.spec.js</a> and see if you can get an understanding of how these concepts translate to more complex end-to-end testing specifications.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">7. Next Steps</h3>
<p>The default scaffolded test provides a comprehensive end-to-end testing example for a typical “TODO” list application showcasing various features of the Playwright Test API. However, this may be overwhelming for a beginner. Instead, try these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/intro">Quickstart</a> - learn core concepts like <em>fixtures</em>, <em>hooks</em>, and <em>assertions</em>.</li>
<li>Get more familiar with the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/cli">Command-Line Tools</a> - I have a <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/dev.to/azure/005-tool-talk-hello-command-line-faj">Tool Talk post</a> on the topic if useful.</li>
<li>Try using <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/codegen">Codegen</a> to author tests, and <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/inspector">Inspector</a> to debug execution.</li>
<li>Dive into the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright">Playwright API</a> to start figuring out selectors and actions you can use in crafting your own test specifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can now go back into the scaffolded test specification file, delete the contents, and start writing your own test actions, test cases, and test suites! Test automation for the win!</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>We covered a lot today. Now it’s your turn!</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a PWA - for instance, a <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.6/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/demo-pwas">sample PWA</a> - to experiment on.</li>
<li>Instrument it to setup your first end-to-end test with Playwright.</li>
<li>Validate setup locally by running tests and inspecting the reports.</li>
<li>Validate the GitHub Actions workflow by committing this to a GitHub repo.</li>
<li>Try out the next steps above - and start customizing your testing scripts!</li>
</ul>
<p>And set the stage for your end-to-end testing strategy with Playwright!</p>

<p>Hello! For today’s post on the 30 Days of PWA series, we will be learning how to audit a PWA and use those audits to help improve it’s user experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-audit-a-pwa">Why audit a PWA</h2>
<p>So, why should we audit our PWA anyways? And what does this even mean?</p>
<p>When we are talking about auditing our PWA, we mean using tools to ensure that our PWA is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installable from the browser</li>
<li>Ready to submit to app stores such as the Microsoft Store</li>
<li>Accessible</li>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Follows cross-browser development best practices</li>
</ul>
<p>We do this to ensure our PWA is the best it can be for users. Users want high quality apps that are accessible, fast and discoverable, and auditing ensures we are meeting these requirements.</p>
<p>Today we are going to use PWABuider, Webhint and Edge Devtools to audit our PWA, let’s dive in!</p>
<h2 id="audit-with-pwabuilder">Audit with PWABuilder</h2>
<p>Let’s start with PWABuilder. The focus of the audit PWABuilder does is to ensure our PWA is high-quality, installable, and ready to publish to app stores like the Microsoft Store. To do this, PWABuilder looks at the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Manifest</li>
<li>Service Worker</li>
<li>HTTPS Setup</li>
</ul>
<p>and audits them based on a set of requirements. These also happen to be the technical essentials you need for an app to be considered a PWA.</p>

<tr class="even">
<td>Suggested fields to improve our PWA or enable new features</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each section above has a set of Required audits. These are audits that are required to be in the app stores and for installation from the browser. There are also Recommended and Optional audits for each section. These audit things such as, for example, manifest fields you can add to improve the installation experience of your PWA, but are not required.</p>
<p>To get started with PWABuilder’s audits, you can use either <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/pwabuilder.com">PWABuilder</a> or the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/pwa-studio">PWA Studio VSCode Extension</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-audits-from-pwabuilder.com">Getting audits from pwabuilder.com</h3>
<p>Already have a published and live PWA that you want to audit?</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab our URL and head over to https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/pwabuilder.com</li>
<li>Enter the URL to our PWA on the homepage of pwabuilder.com and click Start <img src="_media/05/enter-url.png" alt="We have entered our URL into the input on the homepage of PWABuilder" /></li>
<li>pwabuilder.com will now analyze our PWA and return our audits <img src="_media/05/report-card.jpeg" alt="A screenshot of the report-card page in PWABuilder showing our audits" /></li>
</ul>
<p>Each section is given an overall score. If we click on that section, it will give us more details on our score, including what we can add or change to get a better score. Towards the bottom of the page, we can see our total score. <img src="_media/05/total-score.png" alt="A screenshot showing the total score located towards the bottom of the report page" /></p>
<p>If our total score is green, then our PWA is ready to publish and we are ready to click next to start packaging our PWA.</p>
<p>If our total score is yellow this means that our PWA is most likely ready to publish, but may be missing out on Recommended Features such as having a <code>background_color</code> in our Web Manifest. The section that is lowering our score will also have a yellow score. At that point, we should click on it to see what we need to add.</p>
<p>If our score is red, this means our PWA is not ready to publish to the web or app stores and needs additional work. The section with the problem will also have a red score. As above, we can click on that section to see what needs to be added next.</p>
<h3 id="getting-our-audits-with-pwa-studio">Getting our audits with PWA Studio</h3>
<p>PWA Studio enables us to audit with PWABuilder during development, not just after our PWA has gone live.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install PWA Studio from the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/pwa-studio">VSCode Marketplace</a></li>
<li>Open our codebase in VSCode</li>
<li>Click the PWABuilder icon on the left side of VSCode <img src="_media/05/icon-on-left.png" alt="The PWABuilder icon on the left side of VSCode" /></li>
<li>We will now see our audits</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="_media/05/pwa-studio.png" alt="The audits panels in PWA Studio" /><figcaption>The audits panels in PWA Studio</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>PWA Studio uses a simpler way of showing audits. As it shows in the above screenshot, there are three sections again, but slightly different this time: Web Manifest, Service Worker, Store Ready.</p>
<p>For each section, you will see a list of items. If that item is good to go, it will have a checkmark next to it, if not, it will have a caution symbol. For every item, you can click on the info icon in that item to learn more about it and how to fix the audit.</p>
<p>For the best PWA, we recommend checking off as many items as you can. If you are missing something that is required, PWA Studio will give you an alert when trying to publish to the web or package your PWA for the app stores.</p>
<h2 id="audit-a-pwa-with-webhint">Audit a PWA with Webhint</h2>
<p>You may have heard of <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/webhint.io">Webhint</a> before, but did you know it’s audits are built into the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/issues">Issues panel in Edge devtools?</a></p>
<p>The Issues panel allows you to quickly see any of the issues webhint detected in our app. On top of this, it also tells you which HTML element the problem affects and how to fix it.</p>
<p><img src="_media/05/webhint.png" alt="The issues panel in Edge devtools showing an accessibility issue" />.</p>
<p>To use it: - Open our app in Edge - Open <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium">Edge devtools</a> - Select the Issues tab. The Issues panel opens with issues grouped into different categories. - Refresh our app, because some issues are reported based on network requests. Notice the updated count in the Issues counter.</p>
<h2 id="audit-performance-with-lighthouse-and-devtools">Audit performance with Lighthouse and Devtools</h2>
<p>We are now ready to audit our app’s loading performance, or how fast our PWA loads on different devices with varying network connections.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Edge devtools can also help you evaluate and improve our apps runtime performance. Check our <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/evaluate-performance">docs</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>Edge devtools has the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/speed/get-started">Lighhouse</a> tool built in. Lighthouse can quickly evaluate our apps loading performance and give us suggestions on how to make it load faster. It will evaluate our app running on our device, but with CPU throttling and Network throttling to better match what you users experience. When talking about loading performance, it is important to remember that we need to ensure our apps load fast on our users devices, not just our development machines. Lighthouse enables us to do this directly from our development device.</p>
<p>To get started auditing our loading performance with Lighthouse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open our app in Edge</li>
<li>Open <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium">Edge devtools</a></li>
<li>Open the Lighthouse tab in devtools</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="_media/05/lighthouse.png" alt="A screenshot of the lighthouse tab at the top of devtools" /><figcaption>A screenshot of the lighthouse tab at the top of devtools</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Click <code>Generate Report</code> to get a baseline report</li>
<li>Analyze the report and make the suggested changes to our app.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full walkthrough on using Lighthouse to improve the loading performance of our application, check our <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.5/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/speed/get-started">docs</a>.</p>
<p>Using these tools, we can quickly make changes to our PWA to ensure it provides the best experience possible for our users. And, because PWAs are instantly updateable like normal websites, we can get these changes out to our users quickly!</p>
<p>In our next post, we’ll dive into converting our existing website to a PWA!</p>

<p>Welcome to the second day of debugging PWA using browser DevTools!</p>
<p>Yesterday, you learned to debug common issues related to PWA using DevTools. However as you learned in <a href="../advanced-capabilities/">week 2</a> of this series, PWAs are capable of more advanced features like <a href="../advanced-capabilities/06.md">background synchronization</a>, <a href="../advanced-capabilities/07.md">push notifications</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Today we will go through the tools available to you for debugging these advanced features of PWAs.</p>

<hr />
<p>Please note that all of the screenshots in today’s article are taken from Microsoft Edge DevTools, but other browsers offer similar tools.</p>
<h2 id="managing-pwa-permissions">Managing PWA permissions</h2>
<p>PWAs can make full use of modern web features such as notifications, location, and storage, however, for PWAs to use these features, they must be granted permission.</p>
<p>For example, to send notifications to the user, a PWA has to request permission via the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.4/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API">Notifications API</a>, which looks something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="va">Notification</span>.<span class="at">requestPermission</span>().<span class="at">then</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>(result) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(result)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This will prompt browsers to show a dialog requesting users for the permission as shown below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/day-04-permission-dialog.png" alt="The permissions dialog in Microsoft Edge prompting the user to allow or deny notifications from a site." /><figcaption>The permissions dialog in Microsoft Edge prompting the user to allow or deny notifications from a site.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During development, you often need to test different user flows based on whether the user has granted or denied certain permissions. This can be achieved by using the <strong>App permissions</strong> list. With this list, you can validate and manage all the permissions that your app uses.</p>
<p>For example, to reset notifications permission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the <strong>App permissions</strong> page by clicking the <strong>View site information</strong> icon in the url bar or the <strong>Settings and more</strong> menu button in an installed PWA’s title bar.</li>
<li>Find <strong>Notifications</strong> in the list and reset it back to its default value.</li>
<li>Alternatively you can also reset all permissions by clicking <strong>Reset permissions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="_media/day-04-all-permission.png" alt="Steps to open App permissions list and reset notification permission in Microsoft Edge." /><figcaption>Steps to open App permissions list and reset notification permission in Microsoft Edge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="push-notifications">Push notifications</h2>
<p>As you learned in <a href="../advanced-capabilities/07.md">Notifying Your Users of Updates</a>, PWAs can improve engagement by sending push notifications to the user. This is achieved through the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.4/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Push_API">Push API</a> and the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.4/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API">Notifications API</a>, both of which are accessible to service workers.</p>
<p>PWAs can subscribe to push messages from the server via the Push API. Once subscribed, a PWA will start receiving push events even if the application is closed. When a push event is received, the PWA can send a notification to the user via the Notifications API.</p>
<p>DevTools can track all these events for you, which can help you debug the entire user notification flow. To see the list of all the push messages and notifications in DevTools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open DevTools.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Application</strong> tool.</li>
<li>Open <strong>Push messaging</strong> under the <strong>Background services</strong> section.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Start recording events</strong> to start listing push notification events in the table.</li>
<li>For notifications, open <strong>Notifications</strong> under the <strong>Background services</strong> section and click <strong>Start recording events</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on any notification to view the details.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="_media/day-04-notifications-table.png" alt="Steps to view Push messages and notifications list in Microsoft Edge DevTools." /><figcaption>Steps to view Push messages and notifications list in Microsoft Edge DevTools.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since the push events have to be triggered by the server, to test and debug push messaging flow in a PWA, you often have to send mock events from the server.</p>
<p>DevTools provides a convenient way to avoid this by simulating sending push events directly from the browser. To send mock push events in a PWA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open DevTools and open the <strong>Application</strong> tool.</li>
<li>Open <strong>Service Workers</strong> in the <strong>Application</strong> section.</li>
<li>Type your test message in the <strong>Push</strong> input field.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Push</strong> button to send the message.</li>
<li>You can then validate that the event was sent in the <strong>Push messaging</strong> table as described above.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="_media/day-04-push-messages-mock.png" alt="Mock push messages in Microsoft Edge DevTools." /><figcaption>Mock push messages in Microsoft Edge DevTools.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="background-syncfetch">Background sync/fetch</h2>
<p>PWAs can also use the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.4/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Synchronization_API">Background Sync API</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.4/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Background_Fetch_API">Background Fetch API</a>, and <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.4/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Periodic_Background_Synchronization_API">Periodic Background Sync API</a> to send and receive network requests and messages.</p>
<p>The advantage of using these background APIs over Fetch or XMLHttpRequest is that network requests made through these APIs can be deferred until the PWA has active network connectivity and be done even when the PWA is not being used. Check out <a href="../advanced-capabilities/06.md">Synchronizing app data in the background</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Similar to how you can view push messages and notifications, Background API events can also be viewed in DevTools. The <strong>Background services</strong> section of the <strong>Application</strong> tool has 3 sub-sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background Fetch</strong> can record the background fetch events.</li>
<li><strong>Background Sync</strong> can record background sync events.</li>
<li><strong>Periodic Background Sync</strong> can record periodic background sync events.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also send test background sync events and periodic background sync events in the <strong>Service Workers</strong> section, which works like when sending test push messages as explained previously.</p>
<p>These mock events trigger all the event handlers in PWA and also gets listed in the corresponding background services table.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/day-04-background-services.png" alt="Background sync in Microsoft Edge DevTools." /><figcaption>Background sync in Microsoft Edge DevTools.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="indexeddb-storage">IndexedDB storage</h2>
<p>To provide offline support, PWAs should be able to store data locally. There are multiple storage options for the web and you can read more about them <a href="../core-concepts/05.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>In PWAs, a recommended practice is to use <a href="../advanced-capabilities/05.md">Cache storage</a> for storing static resources and <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.4/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB</a> is used for more structured data. You can learn more about IndexedDB in the upcoming <a href="../platforms-practices/04.md">Best Practices for Reliability</a> article.```</p>
<p><a href="./03.md">Yesterday</a>, you learned about debugging cache issues in DevTools. To view and manage your app’s IndexedDB data in DevTools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open DevTools</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Application</strong> tool.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Storage</strong>, expand the <strong>IndexedDB</strong> section until you find your database and the table you want to open. Note that there can be multiple databases here.</li>
<li>Your table appears in the main area of the tool, and you can view the data.</li>
<li>The toolbar displayed at the top of the table can be used to clear the entire table or delete the selected row.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="_media/day-04-indexeddb.png" alt="Steps to view indexedDB data in DevTools." /><figcaption>Steps to view indexedDB data in DevTools.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>After reading yesterday’s and today’s articles in this series, you should have a pretty good understating of how the browser DevTools can be used for PWA development and debugging. A lot of PWA issues can be resolved with DevTools and development can be made easy by using the specialized tools we went over in the past two days.</p>
<p>The feature set available to PWAs is always growing and the DevTools is planning to add tooling support for these new features as well. If you have any feature requests or feedback, you can contact the Microsoft Edge DevTools team by clicking the <strong>Send Feedback</strong> button in upper right corner of DevTools.</p>]]></description>

<hr />
<p>As you start creating your PWA and making use of service workers, storage, and other features, you may start running into bugs. Thankfully, web browsers come with powerful built-in tools you can use to inspect your application’s code and debug it.</p>
<p>On top of accessing HTML and CSS, editing it live in the browser, finding JavaScript errors or debugging them, browser developer tools (or just DevTools) also come with tools specifically made for PWAs.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Today, we’ll cover some of the most useful tools when working on Progressive Web Apps code. In this article we’ll take a look at how to simulate different devices, troubleshoot installability and caching issues, as well as test offline scenarios.</p>
<p>Although we’ll be using Microsoft Edge to demo the tools, other browsers have very similar tools.</p>
<h2 id="testing-on-other-devices">Testing on other devices</h2>
<p>Nothing replaces testing on real devices. So once your app is getting ready and runs on a web server, it’s great if you can check it on other computers and mobile devices.</p>
<p>It’s not always possible though and DevTools comes with a very useful <strong>Device Emulation</strong> tool you can use to check what your app would look and feel like on other devices.</p>
<p>To start <strong>Device Emulation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open DevTools by pressing <code>F12</code> or right-clicking the page and selecting <code>Inspect</code>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Toggle device emulation</strong> button in the top-left corner of DevTools.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="_media/device-mode.png" alt="Screenshot of a tab in Microsoft Edge with DevTools open and the device emulation tool started, making the page appear as if rendered on a mobile device" /><figcaption>Screenshot of a tab in Microsoft Edge with DevTools open and the device emulation tool started, making the page appear as if rendered on a mobile device</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Choose the devices you want to emulate in the <strong>Dimensions</strong> drop-down menu. When you do, the viewport resizes to match the emulated device’s screen, and your cursor acts like a touch input if the emulated device supports it. If you want, you can also click <strong>Edit</strong> in the menu and create your own devices.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>Device Emulation</strong> only works when your app is running in a browser tab. If it is running separately from the browser (e.g. when using <a href="01.md">PWA Starter</a>, or when installed and running as a separate window), then the <strong>Toggle device emulation</strong> button won’t be available in DevTools.</p>

<p>During week 1, we saw the 3 building blocks of a PWA: using <a href="../core-concepts/04.md">HTTPS</a>, a <a href="../core-concepts/05.md">Service Worker</a>, and a <a href="../core-concepts/06.md">Web App Manifest</a>.</p>
<p>Web browsers will check that all 3 are available before making a web app installable. But they also run a few more checks on the content of the worker and manifest before letting a user install the app.</p>
<p>There may be times when the web browser thinks your app isn’t ready to be installed, and it is not always straightforward to know why. To debug this problem, you can review the installability information in the <strong>Application</strong> tool.</p>
<p>To review this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open DevTools.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Application</strong> tool by clicking the <code>+</code> sign in the toolbar and finding the tool name in the list.</li>
<li>Once in the tool, go to the <strong>Manifest</strong> tab in the left sidebar.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may see a number of warnings that prevent your application from being installable.</p>

</figure>
<p>Review and address these warnings, and reload the page. Once the warnings are gone, the web browser should display the app installation button in the address bar, which in Microsoft Edge, looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/app-available-icon.png" alt="Screenshot of the App Available button in Microsoft Edge DevTools" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the App Available button in Microsoft Edge DevTools</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Learn more about using the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/debug-PWA"><strong>Application</strong> tool to review your Web App Manifest</a>.</p>
<h2 id="reloading-manifest-changes">Reloading manifest changes</h2>
<p>While we’re on the topic of fixing manifest issues, there will be times when you make manifest changes and want to test the app again.</p>
<p>Because the manifest file is read upon installation, the only way for the OS to know about the change is by installing the app again. So, in order to reload your manifest changes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Un-install the app:
<ul>
<li>On a mobile device, PWAs can be un-installed like any other apps.</li>
<li>On desktop computers, using Microsoft Edge, or Chrome, go to the special <code>about:apps</code> page to un-install any app.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go to the app again with your web browser, and make sure the new manifest is loaded.
<ul>
<li>You may need to force a hard-reload: open DevTools, then right-click on the page refresh icon in the browser toolbar and choose <strong>Empty cache and hard refresh</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Install the app again.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="checking-if-your-service-worker-is-running">Checking if your service worker is running</h2>
<p>Once registered, a service worker has its own lifecycle, independent from the one of the web page that registered it. It can get started and stopped, as well as updated by the browser outside of your control. As a developer, it’s important to know what state a service worker is currently in, and here DevTools can help again.</p>
<p>To find information about your PWA service worker:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open DevTools.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Application</strong> tool by clicking the <code>+</code> sign in the toolbar and finding the tool name in the list.</li>
<li>Once in the tool, go to the <strong>Service Workers</strong> tab in the left sidebar.</li>
</ul>
<p>From there a few different pieces of information are provided including the name of the service worker file (which you can click to open it) and its status. This tool makes it easy to see whether the worker is running but can also be used to stop the service worker and, more usefully, update it. If you made a change to the code of your service worker and want to test it right away, click the <strong>Update</strong> link to do it.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/service-worker-status.png" alt="Screenshot of the Application tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools, showing the Service Workers panel, with the status of the worker, and the Update button" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the Application tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools, showing the Service Workers panel, with the status of the worker, and the Update button</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you want to debug the JavaScript code in your worker, click its <strong>Source</strong> file name in the tool. This will automatically open the file in the <strong>Sources</strong> tool. You can always go back to the <strong>Application</strong> tool by using the tab bar at the top, but the <strong>Sources</strong> tool is very handy for when you need to investigate JavaScript problems that require checking what the code does step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click in the line number gutter, next to where you suspect the bug might be. This will add a breakpoint on that line. The next time this line runs, the JavaScript debugger will pause there.</li>
<li>Now use the app so that this line of code is execute. For example, if you added the breakpoint in your <code>fetch</code> handler, use the app so that a network request is made.</li>
<li>The debugger now pauses on that line, making it possible to review the values of all the accessible variables, as well as continue the execution step by step.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="_media/service-worker-debug.png" alt="Screenshot of the Sources tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools, showing the debugger paused in the service worker file" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the Sources tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools, showing the debugger paused in the service worker file</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="troubleshooting-cache-issues">Troubleshooting cache issues</h2>
<p>A lot of your service worker code likely revolves around accessing the cache, either reading from it or writing to it. There will come a time when you need to debug cache issues. Here the <strong>Sources</strong> tool will be useful to debug your code step by step, but it’s also very important to be able to see what’s in the cache already.</p>
<p>DevTools comes with a way to visualize the cache for your PWA.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open DevTools.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Application</strong> tool by clicking the <code>+</code> sign in the toolbar and finding the tool name in the list.</li>
<li>Once in the tool, expand the <strong>Cache Storage</strong> section in the left sidebar.</li>
<li>Find your cache (it will be displayed in the expanded section with the name you chose in your service worker code) and click on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This tool will display all of the cached resources in a table. The table is very handy, it lets you search through the list, sort by various columns, preview the content of a resource, etc.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/cache-storage.png" alt="Screenshot of the Application tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools, showing the Cache Storage section, with a table filled with cached resources" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the Application tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools, showing the Cache Storage section, with a table filled with cached resources</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the most useful thing you can do in this tool is delete entries from the cache. This way you can make changes to your caching code, and test again, as if the resource had not been cached before. To delete a cached resource:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select it by clicking on it in the <strong>Cache Storage</strong> table.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Delete Selected</strong> button in the table toolbar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more about using the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/cache-storage"><strong>Cache Storage</strong> tool</a>.</p>
<h2 id="testing-offline-support">Testing offline support</h2>
<p>Making your PWA work even when there is no network connection is key to a true app-like user experience, but it’s almost certain that when coding, you do have access to the network. So how do you test the offline scenario?</p>
<p>Again, DevTools comes to the rescue!</p>
<ul>
<li>Open DevTools.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Application</strong> tool by clicking the <code>+</code> sign in the toolbar and finding the tool name in the list.</li>
<li>Once in the tool, go to the <strong>Service Workers</strong> tab in the left sidebar.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Offline</strong> checkbox at the top of the tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, the browser will act as if you’re not connected to the internet and you can use the app to see how it behaves. For example, you could try to refresh (by pressing <code>F5</code> or <code>ctrl+R</code>/<code>cmd+R</code>) and see if the app loads at all.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/offline-mode.png" alt="Screenshot of the Application tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools, showing the Service Workers section and the Offline checkbox" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the Application tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools, showing the Service Workers section and the Offline checkbox</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>As we’ve seen today, DevTools is a true Swiss-army knife when it comes to debugging PWA issues. There’s a tool for almost any scenario you might be having problems with. You can emulate mobile devices, check manifest errors, verify the state of your service worker and debug it, look at what’s been cached, and even test your app’s offline support!</p>
<p>No one writes perfect code in one go, and with developer tools like these browser DevTools, you don’t have to. You can feel comfortable experimenting and trying things out, and as soon as something seems wrong, just hit <code>F12</code> to get debugging information about the problem.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello! For today’s post on the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/30Days-blog">30 Days of PWA</a> series, we will be getting started with some new tooling from the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/github.com/pwa-builder/PWABuilder">PWABuilder Project</a>! The PWABuilder team has been working on tools for developers at any step of the building process, from starting a brand new PWA to packaging your existing PWA for the app stores. In this article, we will focus on <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/pwa-studio">PWA Studio</a>, a new VSCode Extension from the PWABuilder project, and <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter">the PWA Starter</a>, also from the PWABuilder team, a codebase template to help you get started with building new PWAs.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-demo">Getting Started + Demo</h2>
<p>Let’s start building a new Progressive Web App using PWA Studio! PWA Studio’s <code>Start a new App</code> feature creates your app using <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter">the PWA Starter</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>First, if you have not installed PWA Studio yet, install it from the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/pwa-studio">VSCode Marketplace</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you have PWA Studio installed, click the PWABuilder Icon on the left side of VSCode</p></li>
</ol>
<figure>

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>You should now see a <code>Start new PWA</code> button in the bottom bar of VSCode. Click this button to start generating a PWA.</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img src="_media/start-new-pwa.png" alt="The start new pwa button can be found in the bottom left" /><figcaption>The start new pwa button can be found in the bottom left</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Enter your respository name when propmted, this is normally the name of your app.</p></li>
<li><p>Your PWA will be generated using the Starter and all of your dependencies will be installed!</p></li>
<li><p>At this point, you are now ready to start coding! Click <code>F5</code> or Click <code>Run</code> and <code>Start Debugging</code> at the top of VSCode. Your new PWA will now open in dev mode, with auto-reload, in its own App window. Enabling you to build your PWA in an app-first manner.</p></li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img src="_media/new-app.png" alt="Your new app will open in its own app window!" /><figcaption>Your new app will open in its own app window!</figcaption>

<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the Hood</h2>
<h3 id="pwa-starter">PWA Starter</h3>
<figure>
<img src="_media/pwa-starter.png" alt="The PWA Starter Github homepage" /><figcaption>The PWA Starter Github homepage</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter">The PWA Starter</a> is a code template, similar to what tools like create-react-app or the Angular CLI can generate.</p>
<p>With the PWA Starter, you get an app that: - Has no build system to set up and no boilerplate code to add. Everything is included out of the box. - Has a Service Worker system using <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox">Workbox</a> - Scores close to 100 on Lighthouse, out of the box - Uses the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fluent-ui/web-components">Fluent Web Components</a>, you can build native looking PWAs on Windows - Has everything needed to be installable in the browser - Is ready to be packaged for the app stores using <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/www.pwabuilder.com">PWABuilder</a></p>
<h3 id="pwa-studio">PWA Studio</h3>
<figure>
<img src="_media/pwa-studio.png" alt="The PWA Studio extension running in VSCode" /><figcaption>The PWA Studio extension running in VSCode</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>PWA Studio is an extension that brings everything you need to build PWAs to <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a>. When you <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-3.1/pwa-studio">install PWA Studio</a>, you can: - Start building a new PWA in seconds using the PWABuilder pwa-starter. - Learn how to publish your app to the Web with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/">Azure Static Web Apps</a> - Add a Web App Manifest and Service Worker to your existing web app - Package your PWA for the Microsoft Store, Google Play, and Apple App Store - Generate Icons for your PWA - Validate that your PWA is installable in the browser and is ready to publish to the app stores - Learn more about using the Web App Manifest to enable new features in your PWA - Use the snippets to implement native features that can improve the User Experience of your PWA.</p>
<p>And that was how we use the new PWA Studio VSCode Extension and the PWA Starter to start building a PWA with just a few button clicks!</p>
<p>In our <a href="./02.md">next post</a>, we’ll dive into converting our existing website to a PWA!</p>

<h2 id="lets-recap">Let’s Recap</h2>
<p><strong>What we learned so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PWAs are web apps by default. They can provide a <em>usable</em> experience across all devices and platforms, from a single codebase.</li>
<li>PWAs use <em>progressive enhancement</em> to scale up their experiences to suit richer platform capabilities. They can feel indistinguishable from natively installed apps in that context.</li>
<li>PWAs use <em>open web technologies</em> to implement this behavior. Core building blocks are HTTPS, Web App Manifest and Service Workers. New <em>web capabilities</em> unlock even richer experiences on supporting platforms.</li>
<li><em>Web App Manifests</em> are like app resumes - providing identity, branding and skills information that is needed for app installation (on device) or publishing (to app stores).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we’ll cover today:</strong> We’ll explore the remaining building blocks (HTTPS, Service Workers) with specific focus on <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.4/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/service-workers">using Service Workers</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="pwas-are-like-startups">PWAs are like startups!</h2>
<p>To set the stage, let’s use another analogy. We previously talked about how Web App Manifests are like app resumes. Now think about the PWA like a startup - with each technology being a founding team member with a specialized purpose that helps deliver a progressively-enhanced experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>The app <strong>page</strong> is the CEO - it drives the core experience and remains responsive to user needs and interactions.</li>
<li>The <strong>Web App Manifest</strong> is the resume - it describes app identity, brand and capabilities to devices and app stores <em>for installability</em>.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS</strong> is the Chief Security Officer (CSO) - it encrypts end-to-end communications between app and server endpoints <em>for safety</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Service Worker</strong> is the Chief Operations Officer (COO) - it unblocks the CEO from performing time-consuming or synchronous tasks, and takes proactive actions to ensure reliable operation even when offline.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="_media/4-service-workers.png" alt="Image describes relationship of PWA startup." /><figcaption>Image describes relationship of PWA startup.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s see how this translates to PWA implementations that support desirable traits like safety, network-independent operation, and re-engageability. And in particular, we’ll explore service worker implementation and usage, to make this happen.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="make-pwas-safe">Make PWAs Safe</h2>
<p>HTTPS enforces end-to-end encryption of all client-server communications, providing privacy safeguards for information exchanged over the network. Visualize this as a Chief Security Officer locking down all entry and access paths into your startup and protecting information from malicious third-party access or tampering.</p>
<p><strong>HTTPS support is mandatory for using Service Workers</strong>. Thankfully, as we covered <a href="./02.md">in our earlier post</a>, it is easy to implement HTTPS support. Use modern cloud hosting providers (who enable it by default) or take advantage of free certificate options (e.g., <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.4/letsencrypt.com">Let’s Encrypt</a>) to secure your own servers.</p>
<h2 id="make-pwas-reliable-re-engageable">Make PWAs Reliable &amp; Re-Engageable</h2>
<p>Service Workers are a special type of <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.4/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Worker</a>. Web Workers operate in a separate thread, allowing them to execute long-running or asynchronous tasks in the background, minimizing the impact on page performance (“unblocking” the CEO).</p>
<p>Service Workers make PWA operation <em>reliable</em> by helping deliver usable experiences even under flaky or offline network conditions. They do this by <em>intercepting</em> network fetch requests from the page (CEO) and <em>strategically</em> handling them using cached responses (if offline), or network-fetched resources (if real-time), or some combination of both based on predefined caching strategies for resource types.</p>
<p>Service Workers make PWAs <em>re-engageable</em> by having the ability to alert users to app changes or context, even if the page itself is inactive. They do this by listening for asynchronous push notifications (from a server) and working with platform capabilities to deliver alerts in a device-familiar way. When users engage with the alert, they are drawn back into the app seamlessly - just like with other native app experiences.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-do-service-workers-work">How do Service Workers work?</h2>
<p>From a development perspective, we need to know two concepts: * Service Worker <strong>Registration</strong> - where CEO “hires” the COO. * Service Worker <strong>Lifecycle</strong> - where COO “handles” operational events.</p>
<p>Let’s look at registration first. Like all Web Workers, the Service Worker must be authored in its own file. The location of that file (relative to the root of the app) defines the <em>scope</em> of its authority. Service Workers can only intercept or manage requests to pages within their scope. <em>Placing the file at the root of your app ensures your service worker will manage all pages within it</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s inspect the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.4/devtoolstips.org">DevTools Tips PWA</a> in the browser again. Look at <em>Service Workers</em> under the <em>Application</em> tab. We can see that the service worker is implemented in the “sw.js” file in the root directory - implicitly setting its scope to the whole app.</p>

</figure>
<p>If you inspect the application source (in <em>Elements</em> tab) you will find this snippet of code for service worker registration:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="cf">if</span>(<span class="st">&#39;serviceWorker&#39;</span> <span class="kw">in</span> navigator) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">    <span class="co">// Register the service worker</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3">    <span class="va">navigator</span>.<span class="va">serviceWorker</span>.<span class="at">register</span>(<span class="st">&#39;/sw.js&#39;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4">        <span class="dt">scope</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&#39;/&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" title="5">    <span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-6" title="6"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Because Service Worker is a more recent technology that may not be <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.4/caniuse.com/serviceworkers">supported on all browsers</a>, we test for its existence before registering it. The scope is set implicitly by the file location - the code shows how you can explicitly set this if needed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="service-worker-lifecycle-events">Service Worker: Lifecycle Events</h2>
<p>Service worker registration is like onboarding the COO. Once that is complete, the service worker is ready to listen for lifecycle events (install, activate) to set itself up for success. Think of this as three phases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Registration</strong>: The browser registers the service worker, kicking off the Service Worker lifecycle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Installation</strong>: The browser triggers <code>install</code> as the first event to the Service Worker. It can use this for pre-caching resources (e.g., populate cache with long-lived resources like logos or offline pages).</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="va">self</span>.<span class="at">addEventListener</span>( <span class="st">&quot;install&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span>( event )<span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>( <span class="st">&quot;WORKER: install event in progress.&quot;</span> )<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Activation</strong>: The browser sends the <code>activate</code> event to indicate that the service worker has been installed. This service worker can now do clean up actions (e.g., remove old caches from prior version) and ready itself to handle <em>functional</em> events. If there is an old service worker in play, you can use <code>clients.claim()</code> to immediately replace the old service worker with your new one.</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="va">self</span>.<span class="at">addEventListener</span>( <span class="st">&quot;activate&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span>( event )<span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>( <span class="st">&quot;WORKER: activation event in progress.&quot;</span> )<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" title="3">    <span class="va">clients</span>.<span class="at">claim</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" title="4">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>( <span class="st">&quot;WORKER: all clients are now controlled by me! Mwahahaha!&quot;</span> )<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-5" title="5"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="service-worker-functional-events">Service Worker: Functional Events</h2>
<p>Functional events are those that require the asynchronous or background processing abilities of service workers to support reliable and re-enageable behaviors. For now, think about just two: “fetch” and “push”.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.4/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent"><strong>fetch event</strong></a> is triggered when the browser tries to access a page that lies within the <em>scope</em> of the service worker. The service worker acts as an interceptor - returning a response either from the cache or from the network (or some combination of both) based on predefined strategies. We’ll cover more on this in the next post.</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1"><span class="va">self</span>.<span class="at">addEventListener</span>( <span class="st">&quot;fetch&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span>( event )<span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" title="2">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>( <span class="st">&quot;WORKER: Fetching&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="va">event</span>.<span class="at">request</span> )<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.4/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushEvent"><strong>push event</strong></a> is triggered when the browser receives a push message from a server to display as a toast notification to users. This occurs only if the PWA had previously <em>subscribed</em> for server notifications <em>and</em> user has granted the PWA permission to receive them. Push events are critical to <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.4/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/notifications-badges">re-engaging users</a> when the app is not otherwise active.</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" title="1"><span class="va">self</span>.<span class="at">addEventListener</span>( <span class="st">&quot;push&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span>( event )<span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-2" title="2">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>( <span class="st">&quot;WORKER: Received notification&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="va">event</span>.<span class="at">data</span> )<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In our next post, we’ll dive into details of service worker support for offline operation - looking at how service workers engage with the Fetch and Cache Storage APIs to provide continuity of experience in a network-independent manner. For now, it’s time for a hands-on exercise!</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="exercise-explore-service-workers">Exercise: Explore Service Workers</h2>
<p>Use DevTools to inspect a different <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.4/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/demo-pwas">sample PWA</a> and see if you can identify and understand the service worker hooks and implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <code>Elements</code> tab and explore the application source
<ul>
<li>Where is the service worker registered?</li>
<li>What is the scope for registration?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go to <code>Applications</code> tab and explore the service worker file
<ul>
<li>What events is it handling?</li>
<li>Can you understand its caching strategy (for fetch)?</li>
<li>Is it re-engaging the user (with push)?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go to the <code>Cache Storage</code> section
<ul>
<li>What files or assets do you see stored there?</li>
<li>How do these correlate to actions taken for <code>install</code> event?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go to the <code>Service Workers</code> section - click “Offline”
<ul>
<li>What happens when you reload the page?</li>
<li>What happens when you go to a different site (offline)?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="lets-recap">Let’s Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="./01.md">Day 1</a>: We learned PWAs are web apps that are <em>progressively enhanced</em> to deliver experiences that <strong>scale to device and platform capabilities</strong>. They can behave like native apps on richer platforms and fall back to regular website behavior on less capable ones.</li>
<li><a href="./02.md">Day 2</a>: We learned this is enabled by <em>open web technologies</em> like Service Workers, Web App Manifest and HTTPS and support for modern Web APIs. These enable desirable PWA characteristics like <strong>installability</strong> and <strong>network independence</strong> in a cross-browser compatible way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, we picked a <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/demo-pwas">Sample PWA</a> to look at as we explore the concepts. Now, let’s dive into PWA building blocks, starting with manifests.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-web-app-manifest">What is a Web App Manifest?</h2>
<p><em>Installability</em> is a desirable PWA characterstic that allows it to be added to a device home screen and behave like other native apps - e.g., users can launch them, pin them to Taskbar, find them through device search etc.</p>
<p>The <strong>Web App Manifest</strong> is an open web <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/web-app-manifests">specification of a JSON format</a> that is critical to making PWAs installable. <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/web-app-manifests">Functionally</a>, it <em>governs how your PWA looks and behaves when installed on device</em> by defining the properties (key-value pairs) that characterize its appearance and behaviors. In other words, it describes details about your web app, such as your app name, description, icons, and more.</p>
<h2 id="a-sample-pwa-manifest">A Sample PWA Manifest</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at what a real manifest looks like using a <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/demo-pwas">Sample PWA</a>. I’m using <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/devtoolstips.org">DevTool Tips</a> - and I can view its manifest in two ways: * <strong>From runtime.</strong> In <a href="./02.md">yesterday’s post</a> we learned to <em>inspect</em> the app with browser DevTools to find the Manifest section under the Application tab. * <strong>From source.</strong> Look for a <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/raw.githubusercontent.com/captainbrosset/devtools-tips/main/src/manifest.json">manifest.json</a> file. Apps may choose to use a <code>app_name.webmanifest</code> naming convention if they serve it with an <code>application/manifest+json</code> MIME type. You can find a <code>&lt;link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json"&gt;</code> inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag of the page. The <code>href</code> will specify the file name of the manifest file.</p>
<p>Here’s what my sample PWA’s <em>manifest.json</em> looks like.</p>

<h2 id="manifests-are-like-app-resumes">Manifests are like App Resumes</h2>
<p>That’s a lot to take in right? It helps if you can put these properties into a few buckets - here’s what I see: * <em>Identity</em> - e.g., name, categories, starting URL. * <em>Characteristics</em> - e.g, icons, colors, screenshots. * <em>Capabilities</em> e.g., url_handlers</p>
<p>Wait - doesn’t this remind you of a resume? The identity information, the profile headshots, the list of skills? That’s exactly how I think of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Web App Manifest is like a resume for the application.</li>
<li>The browser is where the application currently “works”.</li>
<li><strong>Installability</strong> is the “interview” to work in a new place (on device).</li>
<li><strong>Discoverability</strong> is helped by “publishing” app resumes (to app stores).</li>
</ul>
<p>The visual explains how this analogy works for PWA.</p>

<p>The browser is like an amazing workplace where people look out for your success. PWAs are apps “working” there - they keep an updated “resume” (manifest) and “link” it in their HTML to tell the browser they can work “remotely” (on device). The browser uses it to “advertise” this to users (“Install This Site As An App”). Make sense?</p>
<p>If the user clicks that <code>Install</code> prompt, it triggers an “interview” between app new workplace (device), The latter looks up the resume for details (profile, appearance, skills) and adds it to its local “workplace directory” just like other native apps. Users can now <em>launch</em> the app, or <em>discover</em> it using device-specific search features. And, users and other apps can now target this app for tasks matching its listed <em>capabilities</em> (“url handling”). Isn’t that neat?</p>
<p>But wait - there’s more. The PWA can also list its resume in app stores just like native apps (publish to <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/microsoft-store">e.g., Microsoft Store</a> for Windows devices). When users <code>Install</code> from app store, they just trigger the same interview process. <strong>Installability and discoverability for the win!</strong></p>
<h2 id="creating-an-web-app-manifest">Creating an Web App Manifest</h2>
<p>From a PWA developer perspective, creating a manifest involves: * Create a <em>manifest.json</em> and populating its properties. * Linking it to app HTML to advertise your PWA status. Ex:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;link</span><span class="ot"> rel=</span><span class="st">&quot;manifest&quot;</span><span class="ot"> href=</span><span class="st">&quot;/manifest.json&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Create your manifest with any text editor or IDE - just make sure your JSON is valid. Start with a minimal manifest to get a working PWA. Then iteratively add new <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Manifest">members</a> to improve PWA experience. Then add capability-driven attributes related to <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a> you support.</p>
<p>Audit your PWA with tools like <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/pwabuilder.com">PWABuilder</a> to find, and fix, issues in your manifest so you can deliver a best-in-class PWA experience to users.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-minimal-manifest-need">What does a minimal manifest need?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/w3c.github.io/manifest#examples">specfication</a> defines a number of <em>member</em> attributes - but a suggested <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/web-app-manifests">minimal manifest</a> should have at least these three - where <em>start_url</em> defines the entry point (default path shown) when app is launched on device.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2">    <span class="dt">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;My Sample PWA&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" title="3">    <span class="dt">&quot;lang&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;en-US&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" title="4">    <span class="dt">&quot;start_url&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;/&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-5" title="5"><span class="fu">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>A user-friendly description of the supported members can be read <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Manifest">here</a> - let’s see what our sample PWA is declaring for instance: * <code>short_name</code> - app name for constrained spaces (e.g., home screen) * <code>categories</code> - hints for stores or app catalogs. (See W3C <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/github.com/w3c/manifest/wiki/Categories">examples</a>) * <code>display</code> - how much of browser UI does user see in app? * <code>background_color</code> - placeholder to show (before stylesheet loads) * <code>theme_color</code> - default theme color for app * <code>scope</code> - what web pages can be viewed (navigation scope) * <code>description</code> - what is the app about? * <code>icons</code> - array of icon images used in various contexts * <code>screenshots</code> - showcase application UI/UX (e.g., for app stores)</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-good-manifest">What is a <em>good</em> manifest?</h2>
<p>A good Manifest provides additional properties that help deliver the optimal experience for the user on that device. This can include: * adding <em>recommended</em> members and <em>experimental</em> members * adding properties to unlock new <em>capabilities</em> on device.</p>
<p>For the first part, an actionable step to use audit tools like <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/pwabuilder.com">PWABuilder</a> that grade manifest quality and help fix issues interactively (see example below). Look for our <a href="../dev-tools/">Week 3: Developer Tools</a> coverage for more details.</p>
<figure>
<img src="_media/dtt-manifest-report.png" alt="DevTools Tips - Manifest Audit" /><figcaption>DevTools Tips - Manifest Audit</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the second part, we talked about two things</p>
<p><strong>Experimental members</strong>. These are manifest members that are being evaluated for future inclusion, but subject to change. Browser platforms may offer early implementations under a <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/handle-urls#enable-url-handling">flag</a> for evaluation - but keep in mind that these could change, and be unevenly supported across browsers.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: Our sample PWA declares a “url_handlers” member. This is an <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/handle-urls">experimental feature</a> that allows the app to register itself as a launch target when user wishes to open associated URLs. There is now a proposal to replace this with a <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/github.com/WICG/pwa-url-handler/blob/main/handle_links/explainer.md">“handle_links”</a> member instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web capabilities</strong>. The manifest can be used to declare support for using new <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a> that unlock app access to rich platform hardware and features.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> The <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/web-app-manifests#identify-your-app-as-a-share-target">“share_target”</a> (used with the <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API">Web Share API</a>), activates PWA ability to <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/share">share content with other apps</a> like any other native app. Watch for Week 2, when we talk about advanced capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last thought. Remember our analogy for the manifest being a resume for the PWA? Where manifest “members” reflect different sections related to identity, characteristics and capability?</p>
<p>Think of <em>web capabilities</em> and other open web technologies (e.g, Service Workers) as being a <strong>rolodex</strong> of team-mates that this app can call upon, to get the work done. They can now list those skills on their resume because it’s a skill they are <em>capable</em> of. However, their ability to do that job on a given device is dependent on the <em>availability</em> of those teammates. Think of “feature detection” as equivalent to <em>making a call</em> to see if the required colleague is around before committing to support that task.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-inspect-sample-pwa-manifest">Exercise: Inspect Sample PWA Manifest</h2>
<p>We covered a lot today - and now it’s your turn to learn by actively exploring the concepts. Pick a different <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/demo-pwas">Sample App.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect it’s Manifest in DevTools. What <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Manifest">members</a> did it define?</li>
<li>Audit it with <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/pwabuilder.com">PWABuilder</a>. What gaps did it identify?</li>
<li>Explore the Manifest.
<ul>
<li>Are any experimental members in use? What do they do?</li>
<li>Are any capabilities declared? What <a href="https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Days-1.3/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a> are behind them?</li>
</ul></li>
